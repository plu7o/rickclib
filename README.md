# C Data Structures and Algorithms Library

This repository contains a robust collection of foundational data structures and algorithms implemented in C. It's designed for those studying computer science, preparing for interviews, or undertaking C-based projects. This library offers a broad set of tools tailored for various computational needs.

## Contents

### Lists

- [ x ] **Linked List**  
  A linear collection of elements, where each element points to the next one.
  
- [ x ] **Dynamic List (Array List)**  
  A list that adjusts its size as it grows or shrinks.
  
- [ x ] **Stack**  
  A Last In First Out (LIFO) structure supporting push and pop operations.
  
- [ x ] **Queue**  
  A First In First Out (FIFO) structure supporting enqueue and dequeue operations.
  
- [ ] **Doubly Linked List**  
  A linked list where each node has pointers to the previous and next nodes.
  
- [ ] **Circular Linked List**  
  A linked list where the last node points back to the first.

### Trees

- [ x ] **Binary Tree**  
  A hierarchical structure where each node has at most two children.
  
- [ ] **Binary Search Tree (BST)**  
  A binary tree with ordered nodes.
  
- [ ] **AVL Tree**  
  A self-balancing BST.
  
- [ ] **Red-Black Tree**  
  A type of self-balancing binary search tree.

- [ ] **Heap**  
  A tree-based structure that satisfies the heap property, commonly used in priority queues.
  
- [ ] **Trie (Prefix Tree)**  
  A tree-like structure used for storing a dynamic set of strings.

### Graphs

- [ ] **Adjacency Matrix**  
  A square matrix to represent a finite graph.
  
- [ ] **Adjacency List**  
  A collection of lists, one for each vertex.
  
- [ ] **Directed Graph (Digraph)**  
  A graph with directions on its edges.
  
- [ ] **Undirected Graph**  
  A graph where edges have no direction.

### Hash Maps

- [ ] **Hash Table**  
  A structure that can map keys to values.
  
- [ ] **Hash Set**  
  A collection with no duplicate elements.

- [ ] **Separate Chaining**  
  A collision resolution process in a hash table.
  
- [ ] **Open Addressing**  
  Another collision resolution technique for hash tables.

### Others

- [ ] **Bloom Filter**  
  A space-efficient probabilistic structure for membership queries.
  
- [ ] **Disjoint Set (Union-Find)**  
  A structure to keep track of a partition of a set into disjoint subsets.
